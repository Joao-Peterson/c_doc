# DOC - The C dynamic object lib!

This library is made for C and C++ programs and implement a data structure to mimic dynamic objects
present in interpreted languages, parsers can be written to convert files notations such as xml, json, etc, to
the data structure.

TL;DR: Sources and include files are in [doc](./doc) and [base64](./base64). Use doc_new() to create a new object and _set() and _get() commands
to interact, doc_delete() when you're done. Also check out the parser for ease handle of markdown files!

### Compilation

Just alter the [Makefile](./Makefile) as needed and run `make release` and the lib should be compiled to the directory [dist](./dist).

### Use

A sample application is written in [example_doc.c](./examples/example_doc.c).

Starting by creating a new object:

```c    
    doc *obj = doc_new(
        "velocidades", dt_obj,
            "max", dt_double, 56.0,
            "media", dt_double, 22.5,
            "pontos", dt_array,
                "p1", dt_double, 23.0,        
                "p2", dt_double, 70.0,        
                "p3", dt_double, 104.3,        
                "p4", dt_double, 22.0,
            ";",
            "integer", dt_uint8, 255,
            "packets", dt_const_bindata, (void *)some_data_array, (size_t)9,
            "future_value", dt_null,
            "some_object", dt_obj,
            ";",
            "matrix", dt_array, 
                dt_array, 
                    "1", dt_int, 11,
                    "2", dt_int, 22,
                    "3", dt_int, 33,
                ";",
            ";", 
            "some_values", dt_array,
                dt_uint8, 251,
                dt_uint8, 252,
                dt_uint8, 253,
            ";",
        ";"
    ); 
```

The syntax is, name, type and then value or values, if any. Objects and arrays must have a *";"* terminator character.
Arrays only hold members of the same type. Members dt_null don't have a value. *dt_string*, *dt_const_string*, *dt_bindata* and
*dt_const_bindata* have a extra value, the length *size_t*. *dt_const_* instances have pointers to const data in memory, so the library
doesn't free its memory when a *doc_delete()* call occurs. 

You can add extra data to existing ones:

```c
    doc_add(obj, ".", 
        "medidas", dt_obj,
            "m1", dt_const_string, "bruh", 5,
            "M1", dt_uint32, 35420,
            "data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        ";"
    );
```
Here you can see the second argument *"."*, reffers to a instance, in this case *"."* is the instance of the object itself, "velocidades". But you can specify any instance inside, the syntax is "member.member.member.member" and so on. 

You can then get a value using a agnostic type call:

```c
    // get value
    double value = doc_get(obj, "pontos.p3", double);
```

In a similar way you can set the value:

```c
    doc_set(obj, "pontos.p3", double, 130.0);
```

And in the end, delete it all, or any element actually, using the same syntax as seen above in *doc_add()*.

```c
    // delete all, but can be any instance
    doc_delete(obj,".");
```

### Syntax

As showed in the [Use](#use) section, the syntax for defining data into the doc structure can be divided as [values](#values) and [lists](#lists). 

#### Values

Values have a name, a type and a value. Any number type has this syntax:

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("integer", dt_int, 45);
    
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("double", dt_double, 45.0);

    doc *example_doc = doc_new("bool", dt_bool, true);
    // or
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("bool", dt_bool, 1);
```

Strings expect a size value.

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("string", dt_string, "Some string", 12ULL);
    // or 
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("string", dt_string, "Some string", (size_t)12);
```

The size has to be a 64 bit values, as the library expects a *size_t* type value or *doc_size_t* or unsigned long long, as the integer literal *ULL* suggests.

String can also have constant data, *dt_const_string*, that is, they hold a pointer to *const char* data, when we delete with *doc_delete*, the library will know not to deallocate this data, as with *dt_string*, the data will be copied first. 

```c
    const char *some_const_data = "Const string";
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("string", dt_const_string, some_const_data, 13ULL);
```

We can declare also raw binary data values with (dt_bindata) and (dt_const_bindata), the syntax is the same as string. 

```c
    uint8_t *array = { 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0xFF};
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("binary data", dt_bindata, array, 4ULL);
```

Null values also exist.

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new("null", dt_null);
```

#### Lists

List are objects and arrays, both are basically the same expect that arrays have typechecking, making for correctness. Also, arrays have anonymous members, although we can name then.

They should have a escape sequence at the end, denoted by *";"*, so the argument list know where to stop parsing.

They can also be defined empty.

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new(
        "object", dt_obj,
        ";"
    );
```

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new(
        "object", dt_obj,
            "member1", dt_null,
            "member2", dt_float, 56.8,
        ";"
    );
```

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new(
        "array", dt_array,
            dt_int, 34,
            dt_int, 24,
            dt_int, 14,
        ";"
    );
```

```c
    doc *example_doc = doc_new(
        "array", dt_array,
            dt_array,
                dt_obj, 
                    "member1", dt_null,
                    "member2", dt_float, 57.8,
                ";",
                dt_obj, 
                    "member1", dt_null,
                    "member2", dt_float, 56.8,
                ";",
            ";",

            dt_array,
                dt_obj, 
                    "member1", dt_null,
                    "member2", dt_float, 55.8,
                ";",
                dt_obj, 
                    "member1", dt_null,
                    "member2", dt_float, 54.8,
                ";",
            ";",
        ";"
    );
```

### Functions

This library implements a basic CRUD, along with add, copy and append. All functions, expect for *doc_new* and the error functions,
need a pointer to the doc data type and a value reference, or value name, kinda like refeering to a member inside a object. Ex:

```c
    "object.value_parent.value_child"
```

Or if you are refeering to the object itself, use a dot.

```c
    "."
```

To create you call *doc_new*, this gives you a pointer to this value, and this pointer should be used to any other calls, as well as delete. Also, any values added using *doc_new* or *doc_add* will copy the name to memory before, so the original string can be freed.

```c
    doc *new_doc = doc_new(
        "object", dt_obj,
            "value", dt_int, 24,
            "string", dt_string, "Hello world", 12ULL, 
        ";"
    );
```

To read you call *doc_get*, it needs a type to work.

```c
    int value = doc_get(new_doc, "value", int);
```

The *doc_get* call is valid for any type, including strings and binary data.

```c
    char *get_string = doc_get(new_doc, "string", char*);
```

To update a value you can call *doc_set*, it also needs a type, and a value with the type being the same as the original, using a different type will not change it to a new one.

```c
    doc_set(new_doc, "value", int, 12);
```

For strings and binary data, the call expects a extra parameter, the size or len

```c
    doc_set(new_doc, "string", "Setting this string", 20ULL);
```

Be careful with the *doc_get* and *doc_set*, since their use is similar to *va_arg* on variable arguments functions, this calls are bound to error if the types are incorrectly passed. This library implements error checking that can help with some cases, but it will not prevent you, for example, from setting string data onto a int data type, storing the actual address of a char pointer in a integer is valid operation, and you will only see that when you check the integer later on, so be careful.

To delete you call *doc_delete*. It deletes from the reference pointer downwards, recursively.

```c
    doc_delete(new_doc, ".");
```

You can also add more data using the library syntax with *doc_add*. 

```c
    doc_add(new_doc, ".",
         "powers", dt_array,
            dt_int, 1,
            dt_int, 2,
            dt_int, 4,
            dt_int, 8,
            dt_int, 16,
            dt_int, 32,
            dt_int, 64,
        ";"
    );
```

Copy data.

```c
    doc *powers = doc_copy(new_doc, "powers");
```

And append new data.

```c
    doc *append_data = doc_new(
        "data", dt_obj,
            "append_data", dt_string, "Append important data", 22ULL,
        ";"
    );

    doc_append(powers, ".", append_data);
```

You can also get references to values using *doc_get_ptr*

```c
    doc *doc_value = doc_get_ptr(new_doc, "value");
    int value = doc_get(doc_value, ".", int);
```

For ease interaction there is a *doc_rename* call that alters the name of a value.

```c
    doc_rename(new_doc, "powers", "powers_of_two");
```

You can also get the size of any type with *doc_get_size*, depending on the type the function will return different results. For objects and arrays it will return the amount of children the type has, for strings and bindata it will return the length of the data and of any other type it will return the *sizeof* of that particular type.

```c
    int powers_size = doc_get_size(new_doc, "powers");
```

```c
    doc_size_t string_size = doc_get_size(obj, "string");
```

Nested objects can be squashed so that a maximun depth of nesting is complied using the `doc_squash()` call:

Before:

```c
    "medidas", dt_obj,
        "m1", dt_const_string, "bruh", 5,
        "M1", dt_uint32, 35420,
        "data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        "nested", dt_obj,
            "more_data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        ";"
    ";"
```

After, with max depth 2:

```c
    doc_squash(obj, 2);
```
```c
    "medidas", dt_obj,
        "m1", dt_const_string, "bruh", 5,
        "M1", dt_uint32, 35420,
        "data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        "nested", dt_obj,
            "more_data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        ";"
    ";"
```

After, with max depth 1:

```c
    doc_squash(obj, 1);
```
```c
    "medidas", dt_obj,
        "m1", dt_const_string, "bruh", 5,
        "M1", dt_uint32, 35420,
        "data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
        "more_data", dt_const_bindata, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 20, 
    ";"
```

Depth 0 is not a thing, since an object would be turned into various values, wich is impossibe. This also implies that every call should pass a doc object or array, a single whole value would do nothing.

A single doc value can be created by using the call `doc_from_string`, where you can pass a string conatining a randon value representation and the call would create a new doc variable with automatic type. Integer representation will have a `int64_t` representation, decimals and scietific notation will be type `double`, literal strings "true" and "false" will be `bool` and everything else will be a string.

```c
    doc *value = doc_from_string("value", "20-04-2021");
```
```c
    "value", dt_string, "20-04-2021", 11
```

```c
    doc *value = doc_from_string("value", "31.4e-1");
```
```c
    "value", dt_double, 3.140000
```

```c
    doc *value = doc_from_string("value", "true");
```
```c
    "value", dt_bool, 1
```

### Iteration

This library provides a macro for doing iteration over a object or array.

```c
    for(doc_loop(cursor, obj)){
        printf("Member loop: %s\n", cursor->name);
    }
```
The *doc_loop* sits inside the for loop, where *cursor* is the name of the iterator and *obj* the object to be iterated over. Cursor has type *doc* that is equal to a child of *obj*, therefore we can access the members value, like in the example where we can printf the names of the objects.

### Error checking

You can check errors pretty easily using the *doc_error_code* variable and *doc_get_error_msg()* to get a string message.
Integer 0 means ok, negative numbers are errors, positive numbers are informative messages.

```c
    if(doc_error_code < 0){
        printf("Error: %s",doc_get_error_msg());
        return -1;
    }
```

This enum has all the errors listed.

```c
    typedef enum{
        errno_doc_size_of_string_or_bindata_is_beyond_four_megabytes_Check_if_size_is_of_type_size_t_or_cast_it_to_size_t_first     =  1,
        errno_doc_ok                                                                                                                =  0,
        errno_doc_not_a_type                                                                                                        = -1,
        errno_doc_overflow_quantity_members_or_name_is_too_big                                                                      = -2,
        errno_doc_value_not_same_type_as_array                                                                                      = -3,
        errno_doc_duplicate_names                                                                                                   = -4,
        errno_doc_null_passed_doc_ptr                                                                                                   = -5,
        errno_doc_value_not_found                                                                                                     = -6,
        errno_doc_name_cointains_illegal_characters_or_missing_semi_colon_terminator                                                = -7,
        errno_doc_trying_to_add_new_data_to_non_object_or_non_array                                                                 = -8,
        errno_doc_trying_to_set_value_of_non_value_type_data_type                                                                   = -9,
        errno_doc_trying_to_set_string_of_non_string_data_type                                                                      = -10,
        errno_doc_trying_to_set_bindata_of_non_bindata_data_type                                                                    = -11
    }errno_doc_code_t;
```

### Printing

While programming maybe you wish to view the data on a structure more visually, by calling `doc_print()` it will print a simple idented syntax to a output of choice, with a function of choice. Calling `doc_set()` or `doc_file_set()` you can specify a standard os custom print call, to a file output, if any. By default calling `doc_print()` will print with `fprintf()` to `stdout`.  

All the calls are inside [doc_print.h](./dist/doc_print.h).

### Struct interfaces

An ugly and experimental feature, but sometimes useful, for when you want to quickly add and read data to and from a doc structure from and to a normal struct. Warning, this will only work for the C language types, not user defined with *typedef*, and with non pointer types, as the unary operator will break the preprocessor macros. 

Check it out, you can set two preprocessor symbols with the name and members of your struct, then include the [doc_struct](./dist/doc_struct.h) header file before your code and it will generate the actual struct and calls at compile time.

```c
    #define STRUCT_NAME struct_ex_t
    #define STRUCT_MEMBERS \
        X(int, value1)\
        X(int, value2)\
        X(double, value3)
    #include "doc_struct.h"
```

Now you can create, read and write to a doc structure from a struct and vice versa using the predefined calls *doc_struct_new_STRUCT_NAME*, *doc_struct_set_STRUCT_NAME* and *doc_struct_get_STRUCT_NAME*.

```c
    // interfaces with structs
    struct_ex_t custom_struct = {.value1 = 20, .value2 = 44, .value3 = 69.0};

    doc *struct_doc = doc_struct_new_struct_ex_t(custom_struct);

    double struct_value = doc_get(struct_doc, "value3", double);
```

```c
    custom_struct.value3 = 75.0;
    doc_struct_set_struct_ex_t(custom_struct, struct_doc);
    struct_value = doc_get(struct_doc, "value3", double);
    printf("struct value3: %f\n", struct_value); 
    // struct value3: 75.000000
```

```c
    doc_set(struct_doc, "value2", int , 100);
    doc_struct_get_struct_ex_t(&custom_struct, struct_doc);
    printf("struct value2: %i\n", custom_struct.value2); 
    // struct value2: 100.000000
```

### Parse and Stringify

The doc data structure has been made with a main idea in mind, ease handling of markdown files, widely used for data serialization, transmission, configuration data, encapsulate data, organize, and so on. So it's pretty trivial and easy to parse and create files to and from the data structure. 

Every call to parse and stringify is contained in a header file with the correponding name prefixed with *doc_*, ex: [doc_json.h](./dist/doc_json.h).

All the type implementes here have a common idea, a doc data structure with a single oject inside, this will represent the file,
so everytime you parse a file, the strucuture will have all the values encapsulated inside a single object with the file type, ex: json, xml, ini. When you want to stringify, the calls expects you to pass a structure with a single object with the values inside, this object can have any name, its only when parsing that it will be given the name of the file type. 

#### JSON

For a json file format, it goes like this:

```c
    char *json_stream = read_asci("./test/types.json"); 
    doc *json_doc = doc_json_parse(json_stream);
```

First loading the the file into memory, then calling the parser to get the data structure, simple. 

Calling stringify we can can make any data structure into a json file, as long as the parent doc is a single object file.

```c
    char *json_stream_out = doc_json_stringify(json_doc);
```

We can even add new data to parsed files and stringify then with a few lines of code:

```c
    char blob[270] = "Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but by this singular passion from other animals, which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continued and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceeds the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure.";

    doc_add(json_doc, ".", "blob", dt_const_bindata, (void *)blob, (size_t)269);
```

In this example we added a long string as constant binary data, without the null terminator character, with any other data type, the strigified version will be exactly the same, except with dt_bindata and dt_const_bindata, where the data will be converted to base64 first.

In the example [json_example.c](./examples/json_example.c), types.json looks like this before:

```c
    {
        "string" : "string_alou",
        "rational_number" : 1.25,
        "integer_number" : 64,
        "null_value" : null,
        "bool" : true,
        "array_crazy_numbers" : [ 1.0, 3.14E-1, 100E10]
    }
```

And after:

```c
    {
        "string": "string_alou",
        "rational_number": 1.25,
        "integer_number": 64,
        "null_value": null,
        "bool": true,
        "array_crazy_numbers": [1, 0.314, 1E+12],
        "blob": "TWFuIGlzIGRpc3Rpbmd1aXNoZWQsIG5vdCBvbmx5IGJ5IGhpcyByZWFzb24sIGJ1dCBieSB0aGlzIHNpbmd1bGFyIHBhc3Npb24gZnJvbSBvdGhlciBhbmltYWxzLCB3aGljaCBpcyBhIGx1c3Qgb2YgdGhlIG1pbmQsIHRoYXQgYnkgYSBwZXJzZXZlcmFuY2Ugb2YgZGVsaWdodCBpbiB0aGUgY29udGludWVkIGFuZCBpbmRlZmF0aWdhYmxlIGdlbmVyYXRpb24gb2Yga25vd2xlZGdlLCBleGNlZWRzIHRoZSBzaG9ydCB2ZWhlbWVuY2Ugb2YgYW55IGNhcm5hbCBwbGVhc3VyZS4="
    }
```

The actual output does not contain line breaks and identation, this is a prettyfied version.

### XML

Xml is a nested structure, with tags and atributes, thinking about that the parser and stringify calls follow a structure. Suppose we have this xml tag:

```c
    <tag atb1="1">
        42
    </tag>
```

It's representation as a doc data structure will be:

```c
    "tag", dt_obj,
        "atributes", dt_obj,
            "atb1", dt_int64_t, 1,
        ";",
        "", dt_int64_t, 42,
    ";"
```

Note that the atributes will be placed inside a separate object called "atributes", with respective name and value, while the value inside the tag will be anonymous and is accessible only trought a `doc_get()` call with the `tag[1]` sytax.

Another example:

```c
    <tag>
        <another_tag/> "string"
        3.14
        <surprise/> "pie"
    </tag>
```

It's representation as a doc data structure will be:

```c
    "tag", dt_obj,
        "another_tag", dt_obj, 
            "", dt_string, "string", 7,
        ";",
        "", dt_double, 3.14,
        "surprise", dt_obj, 
            "", dt_string, "pie", 7,
        ";",
    ";"
```

The xml parser works with self closing tags, and could be used to parse sgml file such as html, mathml, but this parser doesn't garantee to you that it will be correctly parsed.

### INI

Ini/cfg file formats implements varaibles and sections, this is very simple, as every section can be a object with variables inside of it, but they are not nested, thus when strigifying to a ini file, every nested object with more than 2 layers depth will be squashed to a upper layer, making the data structure differ from the original, this should be kept in mind, as stringifying and parsing it again can mess up the location of your variables.

This parser supports comments with '#' and ';'.

Empty variables like this:

```c
    value5=
    value6
```

With and without the the equal sign, making any random token inside the file a empty variable with same name.

Anonymous variables, by using the curly brackets syntax:

```c
    {VAR}

    # empty anonymous variable
    {}
```

Also, anonymous variables will be stringified to this syntax.

Break sequence for strings:

```c
    cont = aaaaaaa \
    bbbbbbbbbb
```

And string literals:

```c
    value1="#value1;"
```
